Description: The Raster package (as of version 3.0-7) had a 'dims' option for selecting the order of the dimensions. This modification of the raster package enables NetCDF files with the x-index incrementing after the y-index to be read correctly. The changes broke other features of the raster package and so were not pulled into the main raster package.
